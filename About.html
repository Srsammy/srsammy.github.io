            <p> We are a group of engineering students from George Fox University. This website is a product of our Servant Engineering class in the Spring semester of 2025. 
                We hope that this project creates a helpful resource for those wanting to start a makerhub in a refugee camp.</p>

            <h2>Our Beliefs</h2>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p> We believe that God has created each human being with the ability and desire to create. Each person was created with inherent gifts and talents that God intends 
                to be used for the betterment of mankind. We believe that the situational restrictions of refugee camps that prevent refugees from working in their communities 
                is not only a waste of human capital, but also preventing them from living out God's design for their lives.</p>
