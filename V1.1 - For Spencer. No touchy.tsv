Bike Repair	TRUE	143.64	3	4	12	Floor	0	0	None	None		3	FALSE			The bike repair module is a space equipped with various tools to allow individuals to perform maintenance, repair, and upgrade their bikes. It will provide users with a means to fix common bike issues such as flat tires, brake adjustments, and more. This module will include basic tools like wrenches, tire levers, and screwdrivers, as well as specialized equipment such as chain breakers, spoke wrenches, and a bike repair stand if you wish to have one (Not necessary to perform maintenance but would make it a little easier). This module would serve as a hands-on environment where people with no experience as well as people who used to work with bikes for a living could come in and address any issues they may have with their bikes.	To use this module, someone could come and set up their bikes within the space allowing them access to any part of their bikes that might require maintenance. Next, they will follow a chart that has videos on how to repair the most common issues when looking at a bike along with any tool necessary to perform it and how to use the tool properly and safely. After going through the video and completing the proper maintenance on their bikes, they will have learned how to diagnose their bike problems and carry out the proper techniques to repair them.	An example of something that someone could do with this space is repair their bike tire. Say something hit your back tire and now you have a flat tire and the frame of it is wobbly. You could come in and select the tire tab, and you would need to watch two different videos, one that would teach you how to remove, patch, or replace the innertube, fill it with air, and test it to ensure it doesn’t leak. The other video would teach you how to perform spoke adjustments to realign your tire so that it doesn’t wobble. Once completed with the help of the video tutorials and the provided tools, you could leave with not only a fixed bike but the knowledge of how to perform those specific repairs in case it were to happen again.
