                                Refugees are people who have fled their home country due to war, persecution, or violence. 
                                They often leave everything behind in search of safety and a better life.
                                After these refugees arrive in a new place, they seek to rebuild life. 
                                However, the needs of each person can vary greatly.

                                Refugees often experience some form of trauma, either from the events that caused them to flee or from the journey to a new location.
                                Providing an outlet for this trauma helps refugees to rebuild their lives.

                                Refugees often arrive in a new place with little to no resources.
                                Because these people lack typically lack resources and have no access to employment, there quality of life is often very low. 
                                Providing refugees with tools and resources enables them improve there quality of life.

                                Many refugees flee there homes in search of a new life.

                                After refugees express there trauma, improve there quality of life, and discover or renew there passions, they begin to flourish as individuals.
                                Weather its pursing a dream, or just living in a place free from oppression, this is what people leave there homes in search of.
