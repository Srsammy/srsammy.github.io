            <div class="centered-text"> <!--class="What"-->
                Cosmetology is a general term that encompasses a variety of cosmetic disciplines. The main ones are hair, nails, and makeup. 
                This module is split into three submodules for each of these categories. Any of the submodules could be combined into the final 
                space as long as adequate storage is available for storing the unused materials. 
                <br>  </br>
                <br>
                This is a skill that is useful everywhere and could be something that can be put on a resume.

            <h2 class="subtitle">Function</h2>
            <div class="centered-text"> <!--class="HowToUse"-->
                This module could act as a salon for those coming into the camp with skills in any cosmetology discipline, or could be used
                or could be used as a classroom space. One module is measured by one station for one service provider and one client. 
                This space needs to include the chair for the client, the mirror or table for the service and proper storage. Considering all 
                of these factors, the minimum size of the module is 3 by 4 meters. This allows for people to comfortably move around the space 
                as well as store all the necessary equipment. 
                <br>  </br>
               <br> The 
                minimum size requirements for what we consider to be a module are determined with a professional environment in mind rather than 
                a classroom. If the space is intended to be used for classes, a larger dimension and/or more modules would be required.
