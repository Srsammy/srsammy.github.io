                    The 3D Printing Module gives people the tools they need to bring their ideas to life. 
                    It's a hands-on way to create real objects from digital designs. 
                    Whether someone wants to fix something broken, make a custom tool, design a toy, or learn a new skill, this module makes it possible.
                    Many people don't have access to 3D printers at home, so this space allows them to use advanced technology in a simple and helpful way. 
                    It also gives users the chance to learn how 3D printing works and gain experience using design programs and equipment. 
                    This can build confidence, open up creative thinking, and even lead to new job opportunities or small businesses.

            <p class="subtitle">HOW IT WORKS</p>
            <div class="text-container"> <!--class="HowToUse"-->
                <p class="normal-text">
                    To use the 3D printer module, start by choosing or creating a design. 
                    You can make your own using FreeCAD or Blender, or download one from sites like Thingiverse. 
                    Then, open PrusaSlicer to turn your design into a printable file (called G-code).
                    Next, get the printer ready. Clean the print bed with rubbing alcohol, load the PLA filament, and heat the nozzle. 
                    Put your G-code file on a USB or SD card, then insert it into the printer.
                    Choose the file from the printer's menu and press start. 
                    The printer will heat up and begin printing your object layer by layer. 
                    Keep an eye on it to make sure everything runs smoothly.
                    When the print is done and cool, gently remove it from the build plate. 
                    The Elegoo Neptune 3 Pro has a flexible plate to help with thisâ€”just don't bend it too much.

                    To use the 3D printing module, you'll need access to a computer, design software, and a way to transfer files to the printer. 
                    You'll also need printing material and a clean workspace with power. 
                    Basic setup knowledge and attention to safety are important for a smooth printing experience.
