                     The 3D printer module is a space equipped with an Elegoo Neptune 3 Pro printer along with various spools of PLA filament for printing. 
                     In its simplest form, it will allow users to create various items that they can take to aid in any problems they have in their day to day lives.  
                     This is important for refugeee camps that don't have access to specific items they might need to live their lives.
                     This module would grant the ability to both those who have experience in this field and those who don't to create speicifc items they might need.

                 <p class="normal-text">
                    Begin by ensuring that the print bed is clean by using isopropyl alcohol and whipping the buildpate off.
                    Some printers include automatic bed leveling to simplify this process, such as the Elegoo Neptune 3 Pro.
                    Load the filament spool onto the printer through the hole in the top of the nozzle and heat the nozzle to the correct temperature for PLA, the material you will be using. With the printer ready, you'll upload the sliced G-code file, usually via USB or SD card.
                    Start the print by selecting the file from the printer's menu. 
                    The printer will heat the nozzle and the bed to the specified temperatures, then begin extruding melted plastic onto the bed. The process is automatic, with the printer layering material until the object is complete. 
                    During the print, it's a good idea to monitor progress for any issues, like poor adhesion between the plastic and the build plate or filament tangles.
                    Once the print is finished, allow the bed to cool before removing the object. 
                    The Elegoo Neptune 3 Pro has a removable and flexible build plate to make this easier. 
                    Gently bend the build plate to release the object from the plate. Be careful not to bend it too much or it will permanently bend.

                     The applications of the 3D printer module are edless.
                     You can design, model, and create an infinate number of things for household items, side projects, or even runing a business.
