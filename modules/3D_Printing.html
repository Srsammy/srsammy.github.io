                     The 3D printer module is a space equipped with an Elegoo Neptune 3 Pro printer along with various spools of PLA filament for printing. 
                     In its simplest form, it will allow users to create various items that they can take to aid in any problems they have in their day to day lives.  
                     This is important for refugeee camps that don't have access to specific items they might need to live their lives.
                     This module would grant the ability to both those who have experience in this field and those who don't to create speicifc items they might need.

                 <p class="normal-text">
                    The 3D Printing Module allows users to turn digital designs into physical objects by layering melted plastic. 
                    Using a 3D printer, users can create custom parts, prototypes, or artistic pieces. 
                    The process involves preparing a 3D model, slicing it into layers using software, and printing the object layer by layer. 
                    This module offers a hands-on experience in 3D modeling, design, and printing, making it suitable for personal, educational, and professional projects.
