                    The main function of a computer lab is to provide a workspace where users can access digital programs and tools for educational, creative, and technical tasks. 
                    Whether someone is learning how to code, designing a 3D model, or researching information online, the lab allows them to use technology efficiently. 
                    Computers in the lab are set up to run specific programs based on the needs of the users. 
                    The space is designed for learning and productivity, helping people develop valuable computer skills.

                    A computer lab can be used for many different projects depending on the available software. 
                    One common use is 3D modeling, where users create digital designs for objects they can later print using a 3D printer. 
                    Coding is another useful skill that can be practiced in the computer lab using free online resources like Free Code Camp. 
                    Users can also research information, write reports, and edit digital artwork using design software.
