                    To use this module, users simply log into a computer in the computer lab and visit freecodecamp.org. 
                    From there, they can choose a lesson and follow step-by-step tutorials in coding topics like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
                    Each lesson includes small, guided projects that teach users how to write and test code in a simple and clear format. 
                    No prior experience is needed, and users can move at their own pace.

                    This module requires access to a computer lab with internet access. 
                    No additional equipment, software, or materials are needed. 
                    Free Code Camp runs entirely through a web browser and is free to use.

                    For example, one of the beginner lessons teaches how to make a custom coffee shop menu using HTML. 
                    Users learn how to write and organize content, format text, and change colors. 
                    As they progress, they can work on more advanced projects like web pages, calculators, and personal portfolios.
