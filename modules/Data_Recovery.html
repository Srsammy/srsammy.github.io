                    This module is designed to help people who have damaged phones or computers that no longer function. 
                    For the purpose of this module, the device's memory must not be damaged.
                    For phones, the DS3000 is the primary tool used for recovering data from eMMC memory chips. 
                    These chips are commonly found in Android phones and store important data such as photos, messages, and app information. 
                </p>
                <p class="normal-text">
                    The DS3000 allows you to place the chips inside after they are unsoldered from the phone, connect them to a computer, and recover their data. 
                    However, it only works with 153 and 169 chip models, and if the chip itself is damaged—either during removal or due to the phone's failure—data recovery may not be possible.
                    For computers, the PC3000 specializes in data recovery from hard disk drives (HDDs) and solid-state drives (SSDs). 
                    This tool can recover data as long as the drive is still operational and can run, even if the computer itself is no longer functional.

                <p class="normal-text">
                    To use the DS3000, please read the instructions below fully and ensure you know how to complete all the steps. 
                    Lack of skill can permanently damage the memory chip, so practice de-soldering a different chip first if you are unsure of your skills:

                    <li>Carefully unsolder the eMMC chip from the damaged phone using the de-soldering guide titled Removing BGA chips.</li>
                    <li>Use extreme care not to pull too hard on the chip while removing it, you can permanently damage it. </li>
                    <li>It should be safe to remove when you can easily jiggle it with tweezers. </li>
                    <li>Place the eMMC chip into the DS3000.</li>
                    <li>Connect the DS3000 to your computer via USB.</li>

                    This module includes the essential tools and equipment needed for recovering data from phones and computers. 
                    It requires a computer workspace and basic technical setup. 
                    No special room or large space is needed, and power is supplied through the connected devices. 
                    A table below lists the tools included in this module, along with their cost and links to where they can be purchased.
