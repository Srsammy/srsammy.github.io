                <p class="normal-text"> We are a group of engineering students from George Fox University. This website is a product of our Servant Engineering class in the Spring semester of 2025. 
                    We hope that this project creates a helpful resource for those wanting to start a makerhub in a refugee camp.</p>
                <h2 class="subtitle">Our Beliefs</h2>
                <p class="normal-text"> We believe that God has created each human being with the ability and desire to create. Each person was created with inherent gifts and talents that God intends 
                    to be used for the betterment of mankind. We believe that the situational restrictions of refugee camps that prevent refugees from working in their communities 
                    is not only a waste of human capital, but also preventing them from living out God's design for their lives.</p>
                <h3 class="subtitle">He has filled them with skill to do all kinds of work as engravers, designers, embroiderers in blue, purple and scarlet yarn and fine linen, and weaversâ€”all of them skilled workers and designers. -Exodus 33:35</h3>
                <h3 class="subtitle">For just as we have many members in one body and all the members do not have the same function, so we, who are many, are one body in Christ, and individually members one of another. -Romans 12:4-5</h3>
