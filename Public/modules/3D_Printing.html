                     The 3D printer module is a space equipped with an Elegoo Neptune 3 Pro printer along with various spools of PLA filament for printing. 
                     In its simplest form, it will allow users to create various items that they might  
                     This is an important module for camps with refugees that rely heavily on their bikes for transportation. 
                     This module would serve as a hands-on environment where people with no experience as well as people who used to work with bikes for a living could come in and address any issues they may have with their bikes.

                 <p class="normal-text">
                    Begin by ensuring that the print bed is clean by using isopropyl alcohol and whipping the buildpate off.
                    Some printers include automatic bed leveling to simplify this process, such as the Elegoo Neptune 3 Pro.
                    Load the filament spool onto the printer through the hole in the top of the nozzle and heat the nozzle to the correct temperature for PLA, the material you will be using. With the printer ready, you'll upload the sliced G-code file, usually via USB or SD card.
                    Start the print by selecting the file from the printer's menu. 
                    The printer will heat the nozzle and the bed to the specified temperatures, then begin extruding melted plastic onto the bed. The process is automatic, with the printer layering material until the object is complete. 
                    During the print, it's a good idea to monitor progress for any issues, like poor adhesion between the plastic and the build plate or filament tangles.
                    Once the print is finished, allow the bed to cool before removing the object. 
                    The Elegoo Neptune 3 Pro has a removable and flexible build plate to make this easier. 
                    Gently bend the build plate to release the object from the plate. Be careful not to bend it too much or it will permanently bend.

                     You can design, model, and create an infinate number of things for household items, side projects, or even runing a business.
