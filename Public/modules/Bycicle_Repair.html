                    The bike repair module is a space equipped with various tools for maintenance, repair, and upgrades on the user's bike. 
                    In its simplest form, it will allow users to attend to common bike issues like flat tires and brake adjustments. 
                    This is an important module for camps with refugees that rely heavily on their bikes for transportation. 
                    This module would serve as a hands-on environment where people with no experience as well as people who used to work with bikes for a living could come in and address any issues they may have with their bikes.

                    This module functions like a workshop. 
                    Those who are unsure or have little knowledge on bike repair should learn from someone who has worked on bikes before, but we also have many video resources on our website for first-timers to reference.
